##Table Builder by CrawlSpider 
This is a very lightweight **[Wordpress Table plugin](https://www.crawlspider.com/table-builder-wordpress "Table plugin for wordpress")** 
to display list of posts and other post types on any post or page of your choice.

## Other post types
In this initial version we have provided the post as the default selection for creating the listings.

The developer is working on adding other custom post types so please provide your feedback.

## Drag and drop column selection

From the available list you can drag and drop and create your own list of display columns.
